A path planning problem for a vehicle using the bycicle model

1. compile the diff_drive_smooth.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) you should be able to compile the program simply by

  $ make

2. execute 

  $./diff_drive_smooth

  which produces

  ./diff_drive_smooth_ss.bdd
  ./diff_drive_smooth_obst.bdd
  ./diff_drive_smooth_target.bdd
  ./diff_drive_smooth_controller.bdd

3. simulate the closed loop in Matlab 

  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )

  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 

   >> addpath(genpath('../../../mfiles'))
   >> diff_drive_smooth
